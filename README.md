Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, we were provided the basic structural code for the experiment we performed with the intelligent agent running through the maze game and created the learning algorithm itself to allow the agent to learn as it progressed through each epoch to improve its performance. In essence, the agent would go through each episode, save the information it gained, check changes to winrate, and then go back through another episode after updating its algorithm with the intent of reaching a 100% winrate.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer Scientists develop solutions to real world problems utilizing the processing power of computers and software to automate a plethora of tasks that would take individual people a much longer period of time to perform. This vastly improves the processing power at peoples' hands in practically every field, whether it be math, science, teaching, etc. As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by breaking down what the requirements of a solution are, what they are as well as how they need to look and perform. From here, solving a problem is as simple as developing a program or algorithm that accounts for each component of the solution that I identified. Ethically, I am responsible for being open about the source of data that I use and how that data was acquired and how it may be utilized in the future. Accountability for using others' data, particularly end users' is among the most important ethical concerns in the computer science field today.
